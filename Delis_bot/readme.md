# Deli's Bot 🤖🍽️  
**An Android App to Automate Food Serving and Ordering in Restaurants**

Deli's Bot is an innovative Android application designed to control an automated food-serving robot. It revolutionizes the dining experience by enabling contactless service and streamlining restaurant operations. The robot can autonomously serve food to a specific table based on its number (assuming linearly aligned tables) and can also be manually controlled when needed.

Alongside automation, the app also provides features for customers to order food from the restaurant directly via the app. Employers/staff can view all orders in real-time, identifying which food item has been ordered by which customer.
